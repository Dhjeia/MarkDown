# Q1
## 备考思路：不需要写稿纸。回答结构：同意/不同意——论点1（大）——论点2（小）。根据描绘==事实/理由-原因-后续后果==三个步骤展开一个论点。

+ ==个人/社会==
    + ==个人的物质/精神(幸福感，面对困难更加自信)==
    
+ ==收费/不收费==

+ ==经济/文化/政治/道德==

**Personally speaking, I definitely think that**
all high school students should wear school uniforms 
**because** people will judge each other on their character rather than their clothing.

**I remember when I was** in elementary school, we had the freedom to choose out clothing. 
I always wore sweatpants because they were really comfortable, while almost everyone else in school wore jeans. 
Other kids in the class made fun of my attire daily.

**On top of that**, uniforms bring people closer together.

**For example,** I live in Japan now, and high school students are required to wear school uniforms. 
It is easy for them to spot their friends on the train and look out for each other on the street in case of danger. 
This would not be possible if they wore plain clothes and blended in with the rest of the population.

# Q2
+ 做题要义：
    1.审题：先导语出来时，可以先记录(letter/policy);
    2.用一个短语概括阅读主题(the reading passage is about schedule changes for stoping evening learning)
    3.审两个理由，==一次性把文章看完再记！== 一般在passage后半段，前半段都是寒暄

---
+ **The reading passage is a anouncement/policy about** campus policy. 

**In particular, it mentions that** the school should hire more professional librarians to assist the busy library.

+ **The man in the conversation agrees this idea.**

==says that完整 + if假设==
(Say/if)
**To start, he says that** the library only gets backed up for an hour or so right after classes, and the rest of the time it is empty. **He argues that** if students could wait until later, they could get help easily without causing the librarians to fall behind.

==refutes assertion(短文) + 反驳(In fact, believes that)==
(R/InF,be)
**Secondly, he explains that he disagrees with the assertion that** student workers in the library don't know what they're doing. **In fact, he believes that** some of them know more than the librarians. **He shares an instance where** a student worker helped him find and print something online when the librarian was unable to do that.

+ **As you can see, the man in the listening disagrees clearly with this perspective.**

# Q3
## 思路：开头直接记主题词，直接飞速略读直接找到定义，慢读理解概念，飞速读完后续文章再记录定义（记录词语即可，答题时连点成面）


**sth is a concept that ...**
**The reading passage goes into detail about** mimicry, **which is** when oneanimal will try to copy some aspect of another animal to survive. 

**1.He gives us 2 examples to explain that.**
**2.The prefosseor provides us with his personal experience.**
*3. The professor gives us a example about this that*

**At first**,the lecturer talks about the king snake. Now, this snake isn’t poisonous,but it knows how to change its skin to red, so it looks like a coral snake,which is poisonous. 

**The professor also mentions** the drongo bird, whichhas learned to mimic the sound of other birds. 
So, after these otherbirds have killed some prey, the drongo bird will start copying theiralarm sound, signaling that predators are nearby. The birds soon flyaway, and the drongo bird enjoys a free meal. 

==最后一定要讲明how主题在例子中 works==

+ 思路1（高分）:跟speaking task1一样的思路，描绘事实——原因——后续后果，第二点相处一个论点即可，想不出来不要紧，写到时候一般都会有思路了。

+ 思路2（保分）: 这种较为容易，不同之处在第二个论点是反驳反方，找出对方的不足之处(while Paul argued that free public transpotation makes it accessible to everyone, he overlooks the fact that...)

**The reading passage proposes three agruements about** incentive programs that reward employees for chieving certain health-related goals, **while the prefosser in the listening material completely refutes the passage.**

**Firstly, the article states that** incentive program help emplyees to healthy lifestyle because it offers them extra motivation such as rewards. **Nonetheless, the prefessor assert that** incentive program only has less motivation. The research mentioned by writter is immediate result, while in long term studies, the participants were likely to go back to their habits, such as smoking or regaining lost weight.

**Secondly, the passage suggests that** it is fair to those employees who are will to adopt healthier lifestyle. **But the lecturer presents counterarguements. The lecturer questions whether** it is fair for these individuals to pay higher health insurance fees or receive fewer vacation days. For instance, some individuals do not have time to maintain a healthy life bucause they are busy with family stuffs, or they may get fat due to their genetic reason.

**Thirdly, the passage explains how** incentive progame is beneficial for company in a long preriod of time, which will be a loss if the employees are sick. **On the contrast, the professor oppose that** this stradegy take long time to manifest its benefits such as for years, but it is less possible that employees will stay in a company.
