**Personally speaking, I definitely think that**
all high school students should wear school uniforms 
**because** people will judge each other on their character rather than their clothing.

**I remember when I was** in elementary school, we had the freedom to choose out clothing. 
I always wore sweatpants because they were really comfortable, while almost everyone else in school wore jeans. 
Other kids in the class made fun of my attire daily.

**On top of that**, uniforms bring people closer together.

**For example,** I live in Japan now, and high school students are required to wear school uniforms. 
It is easy for them to spot their friends on the train and look out for each other on the street in case of danger. 
This would not be possible if they wore plain clothes and blended in with the rest of the population.

# Q2
+ **The reading passage proposes** a change to campus policy. 

**In particular, it suggests that** the school should hire more professional librarians to assist the busy library.

+ **The man in the conversation is against this idea.**

==says that完整 + if假设==
(Say/if)
**To start, he says that** the library only gets backed up for an hour or so right after classes, and the rest of the time it is empty. **He argues that** if students could wait until later, they could get help easily without causing the librarians to fall behind.

==refutes assertion(短文) + 反驳(In fact, believes that)==
(R/InF,be)
**Secondly, he explains that he disagrees with the assertion that** student workers in the library don't know what they're doing. **In fact, he believes that** some of them know more than the librarians. **He shares an instance where** a student worker helped him find and print something online when the librarian was unable to do that.

+ **As you can see, the man in the listening disagrees clearly with this perspective.**

**Firstly, the article states that** incentive program help emplyees to healthy lifestyle because it offers them extra motivation such as rewards. **Nonetheless, the prefessor assert that** incentive program only has less motivation. The research mentioned by writter is immediate result, while in long term studies, the participants were likely to go back to their habits, such as smoking or regaining lost weight.

**Secondly, the passage suggests that** it is fair to those employees who are will to adopt healthier lifestyle. **But the lecturer presents counterarguements. The lecturer questions whether** it is fair for these individuals to pay higher health insurance fees or receive fewer vacation days. For instance, some individuals do not have time to maintain a healthy life bucause they are busy with family stuffs, or they may get fat due to their genetic reason.

**Thirdly, the passage explains how** incentive progame is beneficial for company in a long preriod of time, which will be a loss if the employees are sick. **On the contrast, the professor oppose that** this stradegy take long time to manifest its benefits such as for years, but it is less possible that employees will stay in a company.
